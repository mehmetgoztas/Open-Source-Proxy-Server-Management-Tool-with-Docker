# Open-Source-Proxy-Server-Management-Tool-with-Docker
#This GitHub repository contains a Java application used to manage a Docker container named 'manusproxy' through a user-friendly interface. 
This tool allows you to start and stop the 'manusproxy' container, view its logs, and filter banned URLs.
Additionally, users can query log data based on IP addresses and add URLs to the banned list. 
By using this project, you can streamline the management of your proxy server and gain better control over log data."
